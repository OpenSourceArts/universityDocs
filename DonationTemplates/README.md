# Donation Template Documents
These are templates to be used in memos convincing higher administration to let you make donations to open source tool foundations and collectives. Be sure to note the code blocks where you should replace with your university and depertment info. These were used successfully at the University of Denver in 2021.

We welcome edits, suggestions, or additional versions that might have been successful for your school or institution! File an issue or reach out on email cosa@du.edu
