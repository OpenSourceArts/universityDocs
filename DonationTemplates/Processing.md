**Processing Foundation Mission:**

Our mission is to promote software literacy within the visual arts, and visual literacy within technology-related fields — and to make these fields accessible to diverse communities. Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.

We do this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes Processing (Java), p5.js (JavaScript), and Processing.py (Python), and facilitating partnerships and collaborations with allied organizations and individuals, to build a more diverse community around software and the arts.

The Processing Foundation is specifically invested in expanding the communities of technology and the arts to include and support those who have not had equal access because of their race, gender, class, sexuality, and/or disability. We sponsor a Fellowship Program that funds exploratory, creative, and technical research; support an Advocacy Program, which focuses on nurturing diverse communities and their specific projects; produce public events that provide platforms for collaboration between our contributors; and take part in panels and talks that spread the word about the need for diversity in these fields.

At our core is the philosophy and politics of FLOSS (Free, Libre, Open Source Software.) We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skillset, but is instead a creative and exploratory process. We believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone. We believe software literacy and an understanding of media of all kinds is essential knowledge for today.

**Justification:**

Over time, [*insert university*] and especially the [*insert department or program*] has integrated free and open source software (FOSS) into our courses. We as faculty have made this decision due to many factors, the first being student accessibility. Because students expect to continue producing creative work beyond their time at the University, they should understand the FOSS options that allow them to do this work on little or no budget. This encourages entrepreneurship and allows flexibility as they take their next steps and form careers. If we train them in expensive monopolistic software, much of which now requires monthly or yearly subscriptions, we are committing them to unnecessary costs and a system of constant debt. Additionally, we uphold the [*insert university*]’s value of being a [*private school for the public good*]. When it comes to using FOSS, this means that students understand they are not simply buying tools from a company, and instead they are joining a community of people who are working together to create software tools for all creative people. We incorporate this way of thinking as we teach students to use FOSS so that when they are able, they can contribute to the global community. They do this by contributing their skills to create tutorials, teach others, and help on forums (as well as donate money). This relationship to the software we use is unique and is one way to understand how we can all work together towards a common good. The last aspect of using FOSS for many of our classes is that students learn software flexibility. Some of the tools we teach are not “industry standard” and many times we will look at combining multiple FOSS options for any particular creative task. Students then enter their workplaces, ready to adapt to whatever software is being used, but also ready to create change and help others consider FOSS options. It also empowers them to start new companies where the software choices are flexible and require less overhead.

While in the past FOSS has been seen as “free” for the University and a way to save everyone money, the people in these open source projects have been doing free and unsupported labor. This has created a situation where the only people who can afford to be involved in making and maintaining FOSS have been upper class white men who have jobs that leave them with flexible time. It is now clear that the software we use needs to be accessible to and created by diverse groups of people. The only way to make this happen is by funding the projects and thus paying people to write the code, documentation, and tutorials we share with students. For example, a young black woman who has to work full time to pay rent and also take on freelance jobs to cover expenses for her family cannot participate in the FOSS ecosystem unless she has financial support. It is imperative that every single institution support the FOSS projects they are utilizing, to provide an opportunity for diversity and inclusion and also to help keep FOSS free for our recent alumni and other creative people around the world who have very different financial means.

With all of this in mind, we ask that the University understand that with our contributions to FOSS, we show by example what it looks like being responsible citizens. All the FOSS tools we use need financial support, in exactly the same way that we as a University pay for all the other types of software we use. The issue here is that while we can obtain invoices and contracts for regular software, FOSS organizations cannot provide the same. Instead, they require donations to be considered successful non-profit organizations and to receive additional support in the form of grants.

The Processing and P5.js software tools are key to the computer programming for artists aspect of our curriculum. Developed at MIT Media Lab, they are the most accessible ways for creative people to understand how to create art with code. Additionally, they are highly focused on creating an inclusive community around the tools, meaning our students begin with a supportive foundation in their coding careers.
