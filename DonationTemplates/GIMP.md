**GIMP / GNOME Foundation Mission:**

GIMP is an acronym for GNU Image Manipulation Program. It is a freely distributed program for such tasks as photo retouching, image composition and image authoring. Financial help is needed for different reasons. The annual Libre Graphics Meeting is one of these things. It helps to get as many GIMP Developers to the conference as possible, so that we can do face-to-face team meetings, plan further development, fix bugs, and write new features.

The GNOME Foundation is a non-profit organization that believes in a world where everyone is empowered by technology they can trust. We do this by building a diverse and sustainable free software personal computing ecosystem.

GNOME is built by people. People who are passionate about what they’re doing and care about everyone using, studying, and modifying the technology they are making. The GNOME community is a collection of amazing, inspiring people who come together to do amazing things, to push the project forward, raise awareness, teach, learn, share, organize events, and create the place we call our home within free software.

**Justification:**

Over time, `*insert university*` and especially the `*insert department or program*` has integrated free and open source software (FOSS) into our courses. We as faculty have made this decision due to many factors, the first being student accessibility. Because students expect to continue producing creative work beyond their time at the University, they should understand the FOSS options that allow them to do this work on little or no budget. This encourages entrepreneurship and allows flexibility as they take their next steps and form careers. If we train them in expensive monopolistic software, much of which now requires monthly or yearly subscriptions, we are committing them to unnecessary costs and a system of constant debt. Additionally, we uphold the `*insert university*`’s value of being a `*private school for the public good*`. When it comes to using FOSS, this means that students understand they are not simply buying tools from a company, and instead they are joining a community of people who are working together to create software tools for all creative people. We incorporate this way of thinking as we teach students to use FOSS so that when they are able, they can contribute to the global community. They do this by contributing their skills to create tutorials, teach others, and help on forums (as well as donate money). This relationship to the software we use is unique and is one way to understand how we can all work together towards a common good. The last aspect of using FOSS for many of our classes is that students learn software flexibility. Some of the tools we teach are not “industry standard” and many times we will look at combining multiple FOSS options for any particular creative task. Students then enter their workplaces, ready to adapt to whatever software is being used, but also ready to create change and help others consider FOSS options. It also empowers them to start new companies where the software choices are flexible and require less overhead.

While in the past FOSS has been seen as “free” for the University and a way to save everyone money, the people in these open source projects have been doing free and unsupported labor. This has created a situation where the only people who can afford to be involved in making and maintaining FOSS have been upper class white men who have jobs that leave them with flexible time. It is now clear that the software we use needs to be accessible to and created by diverse groups of people. The only way to make this happen is by funding the projects and thus paying people to write the code, documentation, and tutorials we share with students. For example, a young black woman who has to work full time to pay rent and also take on freelance jobs to cover expenses for her family cannot participate in the FOSS ecosystem unless she has financial support. It is imperative that every single institution support the FOSS projects they are utilizing, to provide an opportunity for diversity and inclusion and also to help keep FOSS free for our recent alumni and other creative people around the world who have very different financial means.

With all of this in mind, we ask that the University understand that with our contributions to FOSS, we show by example what it looks like being responsible citizens. All the FOSS tools we use need financial support, in exactly the same way that we as a University pay for all the other types of software we use. The issue here is that while we can obtain invoices and contracts for regular software, FOSS organizations cannot provide the same. Instead, they require donations to be considered successful non-profit organizations and to receive additional support in the form of grants.

GIMP is the longest running and most powerful open source bitmap image editing tool available. It can be used for photography in color adjustments, and other retouching tasks. It is also used to combine images and in digital painting and drawing.
